I have a few network labs I have personally made using Cisco Packet Tracer and can be viewed / downloaded. If you would like
To interact or view these labs you will need the latest version of Cisco PT installed 


These labs include DHCP, ACL's, VLANS, SVI's, Trunking, ROAS, Static and Dynamic routing protocols (OSPF) , and more
